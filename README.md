This application is used to match records between two databases, perform an automatic comparison of the two records and output a file extracting data from both the record in the original database and all matched records in the target databse.

It was originally a fork of [Alexandre Faure's script to analyze PPN imported in Alma Community Zone](https://github.com/louxfaure/AlmaCZRecord_To_Sudoc_Record).
